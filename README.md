# MobileNetV2-Optimization-for-Embedded-Computer-Vision
This project demonstrates how to optimize a MobileNetV2 model for deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. By applying transfer learning, fine-tuning, and FP16 quantization techniques, the model achieves high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset while significantly reducing its size and memory footprint.
